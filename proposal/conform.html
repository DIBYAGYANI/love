            <p style="padding: 20px;">I know we've only just met and i don't mean to move too fast
                but i couldn't sleep last night because i don't know how you take your coffee and for some reason there's nothing in the world i would like to know more except may be how your hair looks when it's messy in the morning and what makes you laugh until you cry or what makes you laugh when you're crying. <br> Either or both or all of those facts would be fine. <br><br>I know we only just met and i don't mean to move too fast.  <br><br>But i couldn't focus this morning because i need to know your preferences and take out food and the dreams you'd never say out loud but secretly wish to come true. <br><br>If i were to buy you flowers would you want them to be blue and i know we only just met and i don't mean to move too fast. <br>But suddenly your voice is in my head playing on repeat and i'll probably never say this out loud and i should probably get some sleep it's just that suddenly everything that's significant to you is significantto me.ðŸ’Œ
